- ## Why is security important?
	- Often times, security is overlooked in favor of convenience, which is why cybersecurity attacks occur so often, even in larger tech companies.
	- **Information Security**: act of protecting data and info from unauthorized access, unlawful modification, and disruption, disclosure, corruption, destruction
	- **Information Systems Security**: act of protecting the systems which hold this critical data.

- ## CIA
	- Acronym for 
		- **Confidentiality**: information has not been disclosed to unauthorized people.
			- Key cryptography and encryption algorithms 
			- Bank analogy: your password is your key to your sensitive account.
		- **Integrity**: information has not been modified or altered without proper autorization
			- Continuing the bank analogy, you shouldn't be able to just edit your account's balance. Only the bank is authorized to do so.
			- Hashing algorithms
		- **Availability**: information is able to be stored, accessed, or protected at all times.
			- If you can access your bank account and ensure your balance, but cannot access it from other devices or the web server is down, this breaks availability.

- ## AAAs
	- Acronym for
		- **Authentication**: when a person's identity is established with proof and is confirmed by a system
			- Something you know (password)
			- Something you are (fingerprint, eyescan)
			- Something you have (token, license, card)
			- Something you do (speech, signature)
			- Somewhere you are (location)
		- **Authorization**: occurs when a user is given access to a certain piece of data, area of a site, etc.
			- Something else
		- **Accounting** tracking of data, computer usage, network resources, etc.
			- This info is usually found in log files
			- Can include of login attempts, network traffic, resource monitoring, etc.
	- **Non-repudiation**: when you have proof that someone has taken action
	
- ## Security Threats
	- **Malware**: short-hand for malicious software, can include trojans, rootkits, viruses, worms, adware, spyware
	- **Unauthorized Access**: when access to computer resources and data happens without the consent of the owner
	- **System failure**: when a computer or applications fails.
	- **Social Engineering**: act of manipulating users into revealing confidential information or performing other deterimental actions
		- i.e. phishing

- ## Mitigating Threats
	- Three types of controls:
		- **Physical**: can include alarms, surveillance cams, locks, fences, doors, ID cards, badges, security guards, and more
		- **Technical**: can include smart cards, encryption, access control lists (ACLs), intrusion, detection systems, and network authentication
