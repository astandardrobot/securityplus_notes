# 22.1 Vulnerability Management
- Seeks to identify any issues in a network, application, database, or other systems prior to it being used that might compromise the system
- Defines, identifies, and classifies vulnerabilities within a system
- Practice of finding and mitigating the vulnerabilities in computers and networks
![[Pasted image 20220408001849.png]]
- Three main questions:
	1. What is the value of the information?
		- Coca Cola: "secret formula" vs public affairs. You might prioritize one's safety over the other.
	2. What is the threat you're facing?
		- Difference in OS, use case, and configuration
	3. What is hte mitigation that could be deployed
		- Updating, patching
- These three questions can help to scope assessments
- Services like Nessus, Qualysguard, and AlienVault are used for these assessments
- **Management process**:
	1. Define the desired security state
	2. Create a baseline
	3. Prioritize vulns
	4. Mitigate vulns
	5. Monitor the network and systems

# 22.2 Penetration Testing
- Simulates an attack on a network or service, usually done internally or via external consulting
- **Black-box**: No knowledge; **Gray-box**: Some knowledge; **White-box**: Full knowledge
- Metasploit, CANVAS
- **Broad description of the process**:
	- Get permission and document info
	- Conduct renaissance
	- Enumerate targets
	- Exploit targets
	- Document the results
- **Pivot**: occurs when an attacker moves onto another workstation or user account
- **Persistence**: ability of an attacker to maintain a foothold inside the compromised network
- Pentesting can cover insider attacks, too

# 22.3 Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL)
- A standard to regulate the transfer of secure public info across networks and the internet utilizing any security tools and services available
- **OVAL Language**: an XML schema used t odefine and describe the info being created by OVAL to be shared among the various programs and tools
- **OVAL Interpreter**: reference developed to ensure the info apssed around by these programs complies with the schemas

# 22.4 Vulnerability Assessments
- Baselining of the network to assess the current security, state of devices, and the entire network
- #### Network mapping
	- Discovery and documentation of physical and logical connectivity that exists in the network
- #### Vuln scanning
	- Technique that identifies threats on the network without exploiting them
	- **Banner grabbing**: used to gain info about servers and inventory the systems or services
- #### Network sniffing
	- finding and investigating other computers on the network by analyzing the network traffic or capturing the packets being sent
	
# 22.5 Password Analysis
- Used to test the strength of passwords to ensure policies are being followed
- **Crackers**: use comparative analysis to break passwords and systematically continues guessing until the password is determined
- **Dictionary Attack**: a program attempts to guess the password by using a list of possible passwords or common words
- **Brute-force attacks**: on the other hand, try every possible combination until it cracks the password
- **Cryptanalysis attack**: comparing a precomputed encrypted password to a value in a lookup table
