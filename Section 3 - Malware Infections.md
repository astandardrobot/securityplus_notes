# 3.1 Malware Infections Overview
- A **threat vector** is a method used by an attacker to access a victim's machine.
	- i.e. unpatched software, discrete USB installations, and phishing campaigns.
- An **attack vector** is a method used by an attacker to access a victim's machine and infect it with malware
	- i.e. in a "house" infection, placing a cupcake inside a victim's house looks at the threat vector (unguarded house) and the attack vector (everything from driving to the unguarded house to picking the lock and entering it).

# 3.2 Common Delivery Methods
- **Malware infections** usually start with software, messages, or media.
	- These include applications, CDs/DVDs, USB flash drives, external drives.
- "Watering hole" analogy: an apex predator can lurk near watering holes to catch prey. Similarly, an attacker can exploit various sites with malware which, in turn, infects visitors.
- **Typosquatting**: Using domain names that look similar to reputable, legitimate sites (i.e. Facebooks.com as opposed to Facebook.com).

# 3.3 Botnets and zombies
-  A collection of compromised computers (zombies) under the control of a master node.
-  Command and Control (C2) -> Zombie -> Attack Method -> Victim
-  DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks are examples of botnets.
-  Botnets are great for anything processor-intensive

# 3.4 Active Interception and Privilege Escalation
- **Active Interception** occurs when a computer is placed between the sender and recipient and is able to capture/modify the traffic between them.
	- i.e. when you're in a coffee shop and connected to their public networks, a hacker can have their laptop emulate a router, thereby monitoring and modifying ingoing and outgoing traffic data.
- **Privilege escalation** occurs when a security hole in a system is exploited to gain access to resources that a normal user can't.

# 3.5 Backdoors and Logic Bombs
- #### Backdoors
	- used to bypass normal security and authenticiation functions.
	- This is generally considered bad practice, if not breaching security standards.
	- Created in the '80s by manufacturers to maintain systems without going through all of the authentication "nonsense"	
	- Remote Access Trojans can be backdoors, as they maintain persistent access.	
- #### Logic bombs
	- are inspired by **easter eggs**, non-malicious code that displays a funny message, image, or secret feature when invoked. (i.e. do a barrel roll on Google)
	- For example, if an employee is angry, they can inject a logic bomb into their company's server which will do something like delete all files if they're not on the payroll anymore

# 3.6/3.7/3.8 Symptoms of infection, removing malware, preventing malware, 
- #### Symptoms
	- Hardware failures (i.e. noisy fans, crashes, unusual display)
	- Hard drive permissions revoked
	- Double file extensions (i.e. `.txt.exe`)
	- Missing or corrupted folders
- #### Removing Malware
	- Identify symptoms of the infection
	- Quarantine the system
	- Disable or refrain from using system restore.
	- Remediate the infected system
	- Schedule automatic scans and updates
	- Enable a System Restore on this clean slate
	- If a **boot sector** virus is detected, restart the OS from an external drive and investigate
- #### Prevention
	- Ransomware, trojans, and worms are best detected via popular anti-malware solutions
	- There are also many anti-spyware resources available.
	- Spyware is also easy to detect, as unwarranted popups start displaying more often
	- Some scanners can detect a file containing rootkit before it is installed, but beyond that, it's difficult to detect these.
		- The best remediation technique is just to reimage the machine.
	- Verify that email servers aren't configured as Open Mail Relays or SMTP open relays. To avoid spam in your company...
		- Remove email addresses from website
		- Use whitelists/blacklists
		- Train/educate users
- Update and patch systems regularly, as well as educate users on good security practices

# 3.9 Malware Exploitation
- An **exploit technique** describes the specific method by which malware code infects a target host.
- Most modern malware uses fileless techniques to avoid signature-based security software. APTs will take advantage of this in particular.
- #### How do APTs use modern malware to operate?
	- Running lightweight shell code on the vicitm's system, or a stage 1 dropper.
		- A **dropper** is malware that installs or runs other types of malware embedded in the attack's payload. Droppers are also using anti-forensic techniques by obfuscating or encrypting.
		- A **downloader** is a piece of code that connects to the internet to retrieve additional tools after the dropper initially infects.
		- **Shell code**, for exam purposes, is any lightweight code designed to run on the target
	- To maintain access, this malware will a stage 2 downloader, usually downloading a RAT.
		- **Code injection** is an exploit that runs malicious code alongside an ID number of a legitimate process.
	- Strengthening access, the attacker will monitor a victim to look for other machines
	- Actions on objectives: Enough permissions/data at hand to invoke their dangerous code.
	- To conceal their ID, the hacker will leave the RAT and delete stuff log files.
	- **Living off the land**: Exploit techniques that use standard standard systen tools and packages to conduct intrusions
