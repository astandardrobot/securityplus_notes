# 17.1 Physical Security
- If an attacker can physically touch your devices, they can own them
- Physical authentication, identity management, etc. are all important to ensuring a secure workplace
# 17.2 Surveillance
- **Closed Circuit TV**
	- Wireless 
		- Wirelessly connected to the monitoring source
		- Risks interference
	- Wired
		- TV camera is being physically connected to the monitor source
- **Pan Tilt Zoom (PTZ)**: the surveiller is able to remotely control the camera
- **Infrared**: Used to visually determine subjects via temperature
- **Ultrasonic**: Monitors subjects based on sound
# 17.3 Door locks
- Padlocks or traditional pin and tumbler locks are pretty easy to break.
- Door locks can use keys, pins, wireless signals, or biometrics
- Cipher locks are fairly secure, as they require a code to be entered to unlock the door
- Electronic access systems have been more popular as costs have decreased. These require some sort of ID (photo, biometrics, etc.). and can facilitate MFA
- **Mantrap** is an area between two doorways that holds people until they are identified and authenticated
# 17.4 Biometric Readers
- Relies on physical characteristics of a person to identify them, usually using fingerprints or retinas
- Biometrics is considered "something you are"
- Cellphones, physical access controls, locks, etc. are implementing this.
- **False Acceptance Rate**: Rate that a system authenticates a user as authorized or valid when they should not have been granted access
- **False Rejection Rate**: Rate that a system denies a user as authorized or valid when they SHOULD be.
- **Crossover Error Rate**: An equal error rate where the false acceptance rate and rejection rate are equal
