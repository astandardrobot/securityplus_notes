# 2.1 Malware Intro
- Software designed to infiltrate a computer system and possibly damage it without the suer's knowledge or consent.
- This can include viruses, worms, trojans, ransomware, spyware, rootkits, and spam, among others

# 2.2 Viruses
- Malicious code that runs on a machine without the user's knowledge and infects the computer when executed.
- Viruses require a user's action in order to reproduce and spread
- #### Types:
	- **Boot sector**
		- stored in the first sector of a hard drive, loaded into memory when the system boots. This makes them difficult to detect.
	- **Macro**
		- embedded into a document and is excuted when the document is opened. Macros aren't inherently malicious.
	- **Program**
		- infect a target via an executable or application
	- **Multipartite**
		- combines boot and program viruses to first attach itself to the boot sector and system files before attacking other files on the computer
			- Each time the system boots, the virus can be embedded in an application, creating a more persistent attack. If the app is found, the boot still lives.
	- **Encrypted**
		- using a cipher to encrypt the contents of itself to avoid detection from antivirus software
	- **Polymorphic**
		- Advanced version of encrypted virus. It changes itself every time it's executed by altering the decryption module to avoid detection
	- **Metamorphic**
		- these are able to rewrite itself entirely before it attempts to infect another file
	- **Stealth**
		- more of a category. These are viruses that use various techniques to avoid most antivirus software
	- **Armored**
		- have a layer of protection to confuse a program or person analyzing it.
	- **Hoax**
		- Follows a social engineering path, coercing a user to infect themselves.

# 2.3 Worms
- Worms self-replicate and spread without a user's consent or action
- Worms take advantage of security holes found via kernels and applications
- They can cause disruption tonormal network traffic and computing activities. In essence, they aren't quiet.
- Look at Conficker, Nimad

# 2.4 Trojans
- Malicious software disguised as mundane or desirable software.
- i.e. Trojan horse embedded in a CD copy of Tetris to control another person's machine.
- #### Remote Access Trojan (RAT)
	- Provides the attacker with remote control of a victim computer and is most commonly used type of trojan.
# 2.5 Ransomware
- Malware that restrict access to a victim's computer until it gains access
- Usually uses vulnerability to gain control and encrypt files
![[ransomware.png]]
- Have a backup for all your systems
- #### SamSam example
	- Caused $17 million in damages, and they didn't even pay the ransom.
# 2.6 Spyware
- Malware that secretly gathers information about the user without their consent
- Can log keystrokes, take screenshots, which can be sent to the attacker
- #### Adware
	- Looks through emails, cookies, browser sessions
	- Advertising to you based on your "preferences"
- #### Grayware
	- Some kind of software that's used to make something work improperly, without major impact (i.e. mouse mover).
# 2.7 Rootkit
- Software designed to gain administrator privileges in a system without being detected
- Applications have "rings" of privileges.
	- Ring 0 is kernel mode, which interacts with computer hardware and enables admin privileges
- #### DLL Injection
	- Malicious code is inserted into a running process on Windows machine by infecting Dynamic Link Libraries that are loaded at runtime	
- #### Driver manipulation
		- Focused upon taking advantage of kernel-level device drivers
- A **shim** is utilized with both of these attacks.
	- Used between two components and redirects calls 
	- The rootkit will intercept calls between the OS and the DLL, redirecting calls to the enabling the embedded code to run
# 2.8 Spam
- Abusing the electronic message systems, mostly via email.
- Spammers often exploit a company's open mail relays to send messages.
- #### CAN-SPAM
	- Controlling of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act
	- By taking advantages of the mail relays, the attacker can have the FTC sent to your service because your servers are being used to send this spam.
