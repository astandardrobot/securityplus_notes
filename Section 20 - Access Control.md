# 17.1 Access Control Models
- #### DAC
	- Discretionary Access Control
	- The access control policy is determined by the owner
	- Every object in a system MUST have an owner
	- Each owner determines access rights and permissions for each object
- #### MAC
	- Mandatory Access Control
	- An access control policy where the computer system determines the access control for an object
	- Relies on security labels being assigned to every user (subject) and every folder/file/device (object)
	- Data labels create trust levels for all subjects/objects
	- To access something, you need the "need-to-know" at a minimum
	-**Rule-based Access Control**: Label-based access control that defines whether access should be granted or denied to objects by comparing the object label and the subject label
	- **Lattice-based** Access Control uses complex maths to create sets of objects/subjects to define how they interact
- #### RBAC
	- Role-based Access Control
	- Controlled by the system, like MAC, but utilizes a set of permissions instead of a single data label to define the permission level
	- Power Users is a role based permission
- #### ABAC
	- Attribute-based access control
	- Dynamic and context-aware using IF-THEN statements
	- i.e. IF Jason is in HR, THEN give him access to `\\fileserver\HR`
# 17.2 Best Practices
- **Implicit Deny**: all access to a resource should be denied by default and only be allowed when explitcitly stated
- **Least Privilege**: users are only given the lowest level of access needed to perform their job functions
	- i.e. does everyone in the company need to know employee salary data?
- **Separation of Duties**: requires more than one person to conduct a sensitive task or operation
	- Can be implemented by a single user wit ha user and admin account
- **Job Rotation**: Occurs when users are cycled throug hvarious jobs to elarn the overall operations better, reduce boredom, enhance skill levels, and increase security
	- Helps mitigate identity theft, fraud, and abuse of position within a company
# 17.3 Users and Groups
- Computers can have multiple users and groups
- Two ways on Windows:
	- Right-click on an empty area in the Users folder of the ADUC and select "Create New User"
	- Create a new user within the Organizational Unit within Active Directory
- **User rights**: permissions assigned to a given user
- **Groups**: collection of users based on common attributes
- Permissions in Windows specifically (these are generally found across other OSs, as well, but)
	- Full Control
	- Modify
	- Read / Execute
	- List Folder Contents
	- Read
	- Write
- Permissions are broken down into Read/Write/Execute inside Linux
- Assigned to Owners (U), Gruops (G), and All Users (O or A)
- **chmod**: program in Linux that is used to change the permissions or rights of a file or folder using a shorthand number system
	- **R (Read)**: 4, **W (Write)**: 2, **X (Execute)**: 1
	- i.e. `chmod 760 filename`: 7 = Owner can RWX, 6 = Group can RW, 0 = All Users: No access
	- `777` allows everyone to RWX
- **Privilege Creep**: occurs when a user gets additional permission over time as they rotate through different positions
	- Violates least privilege
- **User Access Recertification**: process where each user's rights and permissions are revalidated to ensure that they're correct
	- i.e. Hired, Fired, Promoted
# 17.4 Permissions
-  Inherited by default from the parent when a new folder is created
-  Any permissions added/removed from the parent folder will pass to the child by default, too
-  **Propagation**: occurs when permissions are passed to a subfolder from the parent through inheritance
- Use groups for roles and do not assign users directly to a folder's permissions
- When you copy files, then permissions are inherited from the parent folder it is copied into
- MOVING files, instead, keep original permissions
# 17.5 Usernames and Passwords
- **Strong passwords**: contain uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, special characters, and are at least 8 characters (though, 14+ is better)
- ALWAYS require the user to change the default password when the account is created
- Require that the password is changed frequently (every 90 days or so)
- Always change the default admin or root password
- Disable guest account on your systems
- Enable CTRL+ALT+DEL for logging into the system
- Use good, strong policies in regards to your passwords
# 17.6 User Account Control
- A security component in Windows that keeps every user in standard user model instead of acting like an admin user
- Two benefits from UAC:
	- 1: Eliminates unnecessary admin-level requests for Windows resources
	- 2: Reduces ris kof malware using admin-level privileges to cause system issues
- UAC can be **disabled** from the Control Panel
